JavaScript. The almighty! Almost everyone on the block of web development or even for someone who is exploring the tech world has heard about JavaScript. JavaScript is one of the languages that has stayed high in demand since the day it was born.

JavaScript is being used almost in every application that we use every day. There are over 1.8 Billion websites in the world and 95% of them use JavaScript.

The question is What makes JavaScript stand out from the rest? Here are a few factors stating the popularity and importance of JavaScript. Let’s begin!


1. **JavaScript is the ONLY language that the browser understands.**
Many scripting languages were created earlier to run in the web browsers, but due to JavaScript’s ease of use and cross-platform compatibility, it became the obvious choice of the browser vendors and the development community to use it for the development of the Web.


2. **Easy to access and Learn.**
To write basic code in JavaScript all you need is a browser. Since JavaScript is supported by every browser, therefore you can start to code right away.
For Instance, if you use Chrome, ctrl+shift+i opens the Console where you can enter your first line of JavaScript!


3. **Adds Dynamic behavior to the Websites.**
Almost every single interactive behavior that exists on the web page can be done using JavaScript. 
For Example :
    - Using the Hamburger Menu
    - Show or hide information with a click of a button
    - Carousel of images being displayed
    - Timer or a count-down on the website etc...

4. **Javascript is used across the development stack.**
JavaScript is the most important tool for Web Development. With the knowledge of JavaScript, you can develop both the Front End and Back End of the website.
The most popular stacks, MEAN and MERN, are completely dependent on JavaScript.

5. **Community Support is Massive.**
There is a lot of Community Support available for JavaScript, if you are a beginner there is a very little chance that you might encounter a problem that hasn’t occurred before. There are a lot of really good resources available online for you to get started on your journey to learn more about JavaScript.

These are some of the reasons why I consider everyone should know about JavaScript. JavaScript is here to stay, so it is beneficial for everyone to know about it.
