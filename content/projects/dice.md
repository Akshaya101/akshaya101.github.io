# Dice Game
Welcome to the Dice Game! ðŸŽ² This simple web-based game allows two players to roll virtual dice, and the player with the higher number wins.

## How It Works
1. **Player Turns:** Each time the page is refreshed, random numbers are generated for both Player 1 and Player 2.
2. **Outcome:** The player with the higher number wins the round.
3. **Refresh for New Round:** To play another round, simply refresh the page for new random numbers.

## Technologies Used
